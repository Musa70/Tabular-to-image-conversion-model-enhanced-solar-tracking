# Tabular-to-image-conversion-model-enhanced-solar-tracking

Predicting the position of the sun for solar tracking systems is an essential task in ensuring that solar applications, such as photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, capture the maximum amount of sunlight. Solar tracking can benefit from the effective representation of meteorological patterns in specific geographical locations. However, predicting the position of the sun from meteorological data is a challenging task that the community has yet to solve using traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In this study, we propose a model to learn the underlying relationships between meteorological data and the position of the sun using deep hybrid learning (DHL) techniques. Specifically, we integrate aggregate data normalization using sigmoid and minimum-maximum normalization methods with sine and cosine transformation (SCT) and Gramian Angular Field (GAF)-based image conversion to enhance the data patterns. The model also combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) modules for both spatial and temporal feature extraction.
